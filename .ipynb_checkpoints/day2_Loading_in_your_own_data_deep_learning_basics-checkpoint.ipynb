    "Now that you have the dataset, it's currently compressed. Unzip the dataset, and you should find that it creates a directory called ```PetImages```. Inside of that, we have Cat and Dog directories, which are then filled with images of cats and dogs. Easy enough! Let's play with this dataset! First, we need to understand how we will convert this dataset to training data. We have a few issues right out of the gate. The largest issue is not all of these images are the same size. While we can eventually have variable-sized layers in neural networks, this is not the most basic thing to achieve. We're going to want to reshape things for now so every image has the same dimensions. Next, we may or may not want to keep color. To begin, install matplotlib if you don't already have it `pip install matplotlib`, as well as opencv `pip install opencv-python`.\n",
